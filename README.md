I built a ðŸš— Trip Cost Calculator as a practical demonstration of my skills in Python, Flask, and API integration. This application calculates trip costs based on user input for start and end locations, gas prices, and car mileage, and provides estimates for different ride tiers Normal, Premium, Cheap along with a rideshare-style comparison.

This project highlights my ability to:
->Work with real-world data and integrate external APIs like Google Maps Directions & Autocomplete
->Build interactive, responsive web applications using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
->Deploy fully functional projects to a production environment using Render

I developed this project with the goal of solving practical transportation challenges, which aligns closely with RouteGenieâ€™s mission of optimizing transportation services. It demonstrates my genuine interest in understanding the operational and technological aspects of transportation and my enthusiasm to contribute to innovative solutions in this field.
