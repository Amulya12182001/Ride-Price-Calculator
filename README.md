I built a 🚗 **Trip Cost Calculator** as a practical demonstration of my skills in Python, Flask, and API integration. This application calculates trip costs based on user input for start and end locations, gas prices, and car mileage, and provides estimates for different ride tiers Normal, Premium, Cheap along with a rideshare-style comparison.

This project highlights my ability to:

- Work with real-world data and integrate external APIs like Google Maps Directions & Autocomplete
- Build interactive, responsive web applications using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Deploy fully functional projects to a production environment using Render

I developed this project to explore and understand how solutions like RouteGenie tackle real-world transportation challenges. Through this work, I aimed to gain insight into the operational and technological approaches behind billing in Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT) services, while also showcasing my enthusiasm for contributing to innovative solutions in this field.
